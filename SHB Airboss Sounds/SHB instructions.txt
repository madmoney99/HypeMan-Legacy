The SHB was added to Airboss by Sickdog of Arizona Angry Pilots.

To get it to work, most of the scripting is done in the airboss.lua file (see BlackSeaAirboss_Tanker.lua).  This file contains the scripting to create the Airboss object, and also the scripting to trick the Hypeman scripts to grabbing a modified trapsheet.  The sound files need to be added to the AirbossSoundFiles in the miz, or commented out in the lua.

The trapsheet.py has been changed to recognize this and the boardroom2.py has been changed to recognize the different scores.

Still to do:
- add a proper icon for SHB Unicorn
- add colors for NG and (OK) SH passes
